\textsc{\Large Slower Than Dirt Tunebook}\\[0.5cm]


\begin{minipage}{6in}

This tunebook contains tunes commonly played at the Slower Than Dirt 
old-time jam in Seattle, where ``commonly'' means ``played more than twice
since I've been keeping records''. It is almost certainly missing a few
commonly-played tunes which haven't been transcribed yet. For the full logs
of what's been played, see \url{http://slowerthandirt.org/tune-list/}

I am trying to make fresh transcriptions of all these tunes, but in some 
cases I have cribbed from a previously-published book. Usually I will have
made some minor changes to those tunes to reflect more closely how they're
played at the jam, and I have included attribution notes for tunes I didn't
transcribe by ear. My intent is to eventually replace any transcriptions 
borrowed from books with transcriptions entirely my own. This is a work
in progress.

These transcriptions are mostly stripped-down versions suitable for learning
the basic tune, not exact transcriptions of any particular performance. As
such, they should definitely not be used as a canonical source of how any 
tune ``should'' sound. Add your own variations, search out YouTube videos and
recordings, and learn from other players in your area how they play it. The
goal of this tunebook is to be descriptive, not prescriptive.

Tools used in the preparation of this tunebook include abcm2ps,
EasyABC and {\LaTeX}. The idea came from Paul Hardy's tunebooks at
\url{http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/}.  There is a GitHub
repository of files at \url{https://github.com/rjl20/abc-tunebook}
which should (with some modification) be sufficient for you to create
your own set of tunebooks.


The current version of this tunebook as well as other collections I've
prepared, in both ABC and PDF formats, is available at 
\url{http://slowerthandirt.org/tunebooks/} -- check the version in the page
footers against the version listed on the site before downloading a new
copy.

underlying compositions. It is up to the performer to determine
whether a composition is in the public domain in his or her
jurisdiction.
