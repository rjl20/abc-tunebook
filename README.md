============

Old-time tune transcriptions in ABC format, mainly from jams around Seattle:

* Slower Than Dirt: http://slowerthandirt.org/
* Dusty Strings Second Sunday: http://store.dustystrings.com/t-3-ms-JMS-oldtime.aspx
* Wedgwood Alehouse Tuesday Jam: http://wedgwoodalehouse.com/

To Do:

* Write script to extract incipits, sorted by key and title

About the scripts: the code is terrible. I'm a sysadmin, not a
developer.  If someone wants to clean these up, that'd be great;
otherwise, they work well enough for my purposes now that I'll
probably only work on them when I need them to do something else.
