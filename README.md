abc-tunebook
============

Old-time tune transcriptions in ABC format, mainly from jams around Seattle:

* Slower Than Dirt: http://slowerthandirt.org/
* Dusty Strings Second Sunday: http://store.dustystrings.com/t-3-ms-JMS-oldtime.aspx
* Wedgwood Alehouse Tuesday Jam: http://wedgwoodalehouse.com/

To Do:

* Write script to extract incipits, sorted by key and title
* Write script to create indexes by key and title
* Separate cover page from tunebook, insert indexes 
* Write a better makefile
* Improve formatting -- different margins for even/odd pages?
